This game was made in just 72h hours(everything but the 2 background musics) for the Ludum Dare 48th edition.  
The game is made with python, using the library pygame and a little custom engine i wrote that i will never use again(Godot team).  
This game was a lot of fun to work on(stressful as well but who cares) and ended up way better than I expected.

This GitHub repository contains both the **untouched and horrible** Ludum Dare submitted code and the _non spaghetti code_ one under 2 different branches.  
If you don't see the branch where i made the code look better, it's probably 'cause i haven't found the time and willingness to look at my code again XD.
